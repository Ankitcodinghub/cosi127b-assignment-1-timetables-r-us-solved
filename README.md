<h1>1&nbsp;&nbsp; Background</h1>
Your school needs a database system to help with the construction of their class schedules (or timetable). A timetable is a dayto-day schedule describing what classes are taught when and to whom. By using a database to manage timetables, the constructor of a school‚Äôs timetable (the timetable) can define queries that determine individual teacher schedules and individual student schedules. As well, queries can reveal conflicts in the timetable, such as teacher conflicts which occur when a teacher has been scheduled to teach two classes at the same time, and homeroom conflicts which occur when a student has been scheduled to take two classes at the same time.

A simple timetable is illustrated in Table 1. This timetable has columns for every ‚Äúhomeroom‚Äù (10A, 10B, 11A and 11B) and rows for every period (1-4). A given entry in this timetable illustrates which course has been scheduled to be taught at a particular time. For example, Grade 11 English (which is taught by Cole to Homeroom 11A) has been scheduled for period 1, while Grade 10 French (taught to homerooms 10A and 10B by Cole, Glass and Marsalis) has been scheduled for period 3.‚Äô

<strong>Table 1: A Simple Timetable </strong>

&nbsp;

‚ÄòThe purpose of having multiple teachers and homerooms for a given course (as is done in this example for French and Math) is to permit ‚Äústreaming‚Äù; the grouping of students in classes according to their abilities. Because Math and French are taught to all students in a given grade at the same time, good students from both homerooms in that grade can be taught together as can average and weak students.

&nbsp;

<h1>2&nbsp; Assignment Overview</h1>
For this assignment, you will define a set of queries over a timetabling database that will be provided for you. These queries will allow the timetable to recognize conflicts in a given timetable (e.g., a teacher who has been scheduled to teach two classes at one time, or a homeroom that has been scheduled to take two classes at one time), as well as view teacher and homeroom schedules, find when a teacher has been overscheduled on any given day etc.

You will define SQL queries over a timetable database. The purpose of this assignment is to help you become familiar with Postgres and to give you practice in writing sophisticated SQL queries.

<h1>3&nbsp; Assignment Particulars</h1>
<strong>What you will be given:</strong> You will be provided with a Postgres database with the same name as your login name, and to which you have exclusive read and write access. This database includes the tables shown below with their respective schemas:

<table width="420">

&nbsp;

Table Courses describes all courses that are taught in the school. As we saw with the timetable of Figure 1, a course can have a single teacher and be taught to a single homeroom (e.g., English, taught to homeroom 11A by Cole), or can have multiple teachers and be taught to multiple homerooms (e.g., Math, taught to homerooms 10A and 10B by Corea, Burton and Metheny). Each course has a course number (cno), a subject (subj) and a number indicating the number of periods it must be assigned within the timetable (nper).

&nbsp;

Table Teachers names every teacher in the school (tname) and indicates how many periods a week they have to teach (tload). Table Grades lists every homeroom (hr) for every grade (grade). Table Periods lists all of the periods that appear on a schedule. (day and per). Table taught by shows every teacher (tname) who has been assigned to teach each course (cno). Table Taught to shows every homeroom (grade, hr) to whom each course (cno) is taught. (Courses such as Math that are taught to all homerooms in a particular grade are assigned hr = ‚ÄòZ‚Äô). Finally, table Assigned shows which periods (day, per) have been assigned to what courses (cno).<sup>2 </sup>

&nbsp;

You will be posing numerous SQL queries over your timetable database in order to complete a set of tasks. A given task may require one or more queries. You may use temporary tables only from queries 19 to 24. You should submit (electronically and in hard copy) a list of SQL queries you constructed to perform the tasks described.

&nbsp;

<sup>2</sup>The table Assigned Backup is identical to Assigned and can be used as a backup table if you decide you have made mistakes in updating table Assigned. Note: DO NOT UPDATE Assigned Backup. Instead, if you want to start the assignment from scratch, delete all entries in table Assigned using the SQL command

delete from Assigned,

and then copy all rows of Assigned Backup into Assigned using the SQL command,

insert into Assigned select * from Assigned Backup.

&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>Write a query over table Assigned to populate the table, Periods. The result of your query should generate the table containing all periods that appear in the table sorted by day and by period. Therefore, your query should generate a table whose first 9 rows (if ordered by day, per) are shown below:</li>
</ol>
<table width="73">

If Burton has been assigned to teach on periods A1 and C2, Corea has been assigned to teach periods A1 and B1, and Metheny has been assigned to teach periods A1 and D2, then your query should associate course #1 with periods A1, B1, C2 and D2.</li>
